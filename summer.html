        <h1>Summer</h1>
        <p style="font-size:2vw">I like summer and here is why. I like it because it's warm and toasty. And it's the perfect time to have ice cream. It's also a good ti to go to the pool! It's a good time to meet with family and friends! And it's a good time to go mountain biking and hiking! And that's why I like summer.</p>
