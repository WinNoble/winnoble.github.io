        <h1>Spring</h1>
        <p style="font-size:2vw">I'm excited for spring. Because all the flowers will bloom the Leaves will come back on the trees. And that means more play dates because of the hotter weather. It's almost the greenest season. But the bad thing about spring is the bees. I'm scared of bees if you brought a bee to me I would run. Now on to the rain I like it I just don't like it all the time and it's wet. And this is all the reasons I like spring.</p>
